# GoodWeeds

## Introduction

Curate your strain profile and join a community centered around helping people find and share strains they love. A MySQL database and RESTful API allow users to browse popular weed strains, add strains to favorites, and post reviews to the WeedFeed. The live link can be found [here](https://tranquil-tor-86628.herokuapp.com/) and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/graycodesnu/goodWeeds).
